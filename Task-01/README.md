## ✍ Reflection (My Own Words)
To me, AI-Driven Development has completely changed how software is built. Previously, developers spent weeks or months coding workflows and building applications manually. Now, through AI, complex projects can be created in hours or days using reasoning, prompts, and communication.

AI acts as a *co-developer, helping with automation, generation, and execution. Humans guide AI using logic, planning, and evaluation. In the future, **Human + AI collaboration* will define successful software development. Those who adapt will thrive; those who don’t will fall behind.
